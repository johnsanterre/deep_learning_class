# Week 8: Introduction to Embeddings

## Overview
This week focuses on embeddings, a crucial concept in deep learning that allows us to represent discrete objects (like words or items) as continuous vectors. Students will learn about different embedding techniques and their applications.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students should be able to:
- Understand the concept of embeddings and their importance
- Implement various embedding techniques
- Use pre-trained embeddings effectively
- Evaluate embedding quality
- Apply embeddings to real-world problems

## Topics Covered
1. **Embedding Fundamentals**
   - What are embeddings?
   - Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
   - Item embeddings
   - Contextual embeddings
   - Embedding spaces and their properties

2. **Implementation Techniques**
   - Creating embedding layers in PyTorch and TensorFlow
   - Training embeddings from scratch
   - Using pre-trained embeddings
   - Fine-tuning embeddings for specific tasks

3. **Applications and Analysis**
   - Text classification with embeddings
   - Recommendation systems
   - Visualization of embedding spaces
   - Similarity calculations
   - Analogical reasoning

## Required Reading
- Original Word2Vec papers
- GloVe paper
- Framework documentation on embedding layers
