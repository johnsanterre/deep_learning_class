# Week 5: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview
This week introduces Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized architecture designed for processing grid-like data, particularly images. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of CNNs and implement them using both PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students should be able to:
- Understand the basic components of CNNs (convolution layers, pooling layers, etc.)
- Implement CNNs using PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Apply CNNs to image classification tasks
- Visualize and interpret CNN features
- Debug and optimize CNN architectures
